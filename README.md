All the necessary info about the battery (its current charge, plugged in "status") is contained in the app menu, as well as the option to change the charging threshold (initially it is set at 85%).

You can change the threshold simply by entering a value into the window. The app can also work as a battery monitor that displays the battery percentage.

## TODO's

- It would be cool to not only notify the user in the OSX Notification Center, but also to send a message that would remind him to unplug the computer.

## Version 0.1.1

- After the update, the app no longer resides in the bottom bar when active (initially it was visible both in the dock and the status bar). It is visible only in the status bar
- Some errors that caused the app to crash were removed.
