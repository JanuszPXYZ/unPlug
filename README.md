# unPlug
A small status bar application to notify the user to unplug the MacBook from charging.

All the necessary info about the battery (its current charge, plugged in "status") is contained in the app menu, as well as the option to change the charging threshold (initially it is set at 85%).

You can change the threshold simply by entering a value into the window. The app can also work as a battery monitor that displays the battery percentage. 


## TODO's

- It would be cool to not only notify the user in the OSX Notification Center, but also to send a message that would remind him to unplug the computer.
- The standalone app was successfully compiled, so maybe releasing it somewhere? :)
